# NusaStat Dashboard - Copilot Instructions

## Project Overview

This is an R Shiny dashboard project called "NusaStat" for Indonesian social vulnerability statistical analysis. The dashboard provides comprehensive statistical analysis capabilities including data management, exploratory analysis, assumption testing, inferential statistics, and multiple linear regression.

## Code Style and Standards

### R Coding Standards

- Use camelCase for variable names and snake_case for function names
- Include comprehensive comments for complex statistical procedures
- Use modular approach with separate files for UI and server logic
- Implement proper error handling with try-catch blocks
- Validate data inputs before processing
- Use reactive programming patterns appropriately

### Shiny Best Practices

- Use Shiny modules for reusable components
- Implement proper reactive patterns (reactive, observe, observeEvent)
- Use namespacing (NS) for module identification
- Implement proper session management
- Use validate() and req() for input validation
- Handle user notifications appropriately

### Statistical Analysis Standards

- Always validate statistical assumptions before applying tests
- Provide clear interpretations of statistical results
- Include proper hypothesis statements (H0 and H1)
- Use appropriate significance levels (Î± = 0.05 default)
- Implement proper degrees of freedom calculations
- Provide confidence intervals where applicable

## File Structure Guidelines

### Main Files

- `app.R`: Main application file that sources modules and defines UI/server
- `global.R`: Global configurations, package loading, and utility functions
- `R/ui_modules.R`: All UI module definitions
- `R/server_modules.R`: Main server module implementations
- `R/additional_server_modules.R`: Additional server modules for statistical tests

### Data Management

- Store data files in `data/` directory
- Use CSV format for data files
- Implement data validation functions
- Create sample data when real data is not available
- Use proper data types and handle missing values

### Styling and Assets

- Custom CSS in `www/custom.css`
- Use modern, responsive design principles
- Implement consistent color schemes
- Ensure accessibility compliance
- Use proper typography and spacing

## Statistical Implementation Guidelines

### Data Exploration

- Implement descriptive statistics with proper formatting
- Create interactive visualizations using plotly

### Hypothesis Testing

- Implement proper test selection based on data characteristics
- Check assumptions before applying parametric tests
- Provide non-parametric alternatives when needed
- Include effect size calculations where appropriate
- Generate automated interpretations with decision rules

### Regression Analysis

- Implement comprehensive assumption testing (VIF, Breusch-Pagan, Shapiro-Wilk)
- Provide model equation generation
- Include residual analysis and diagnostic plots
- Implement proper variable selection procedures
- Generate comprehensive model interpretations

## User Interface Guidelines

### Dashboard Design
