# Corrected Unused Code Analysis Report

**Generated:** July 19, 2025
**Repository:** ALIVA Dashboard

## Executive Summary

After analyzing the modular architecture of the ALIVA Dashboard, here are the corrected findings:

- **Total R files analyzed:** 22
- **Actually unused files:** 0
- **Total functions analyzed:** 62
- **Actually unused functions:** 4

## Key Findings

### ✅ All Module Files Are Used
The previous analysis incorrectly identified all 16 module files as unused. However, these files are actually loaded through the modular architecture:

1. **`R/load_modules.R`** dynamically sources all module files using a loop
2. **`app.R`** calls `load_all_modules()` which loads all UI/server files
3. **All 8 modules** are properly registered and called in the application:
   - beranda (home page)
   - manajemen_data (data management)
   - eksplorasi (data exploration)
   - uji_asumsi (assumption testing)
   - uji_rata (mean tests)
   - uji_prop_var (proportion & variance tests)
   - uji_anova (ANOVA tests)
   - regresi (regression analysis)

### ❌ Actually Unused Functions

The following 4 functions are defined in `global.R` but never called:

1. **`generate_clean_report()`** - PDF report generation function
2. **`interpret_with_recommendations()`** - Statistical interpretation helper
3. **`render_pdf_safely()`** - Safe PDF rendering function
4. **`render_word_safely()`** - Safe Word document rendering function

## Detailed Analysis

### File Usage Verification

| File | Status | Usage Pattern |
|------|--------|---------------|
| `app.R` | ✅ Used | Main application entry point |
| `global.R` | ✅ Used | Sourced by app.R and validation |
| `launch_dashboard.R` | ✅ Used | Referenced in documentation |
| `validate_dashboard.R` | ✅ Used | Standalone validation script |
| `R/load_modules.R` | ✅ Used | Sourced by app.R |
| `R/utils/interpretation_helpers.R` | ✅ Used | Sourced by global.R |
| **All module files** | ✅ Used | Loaded via modular architecture |

### Function Usage Analysis

Out of 62 functions defined:
- **58 functions** are actively used
- **4 functions** are potentially unused (all related to report generation)

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Review unused functions:** The 4 unused functions appear to be part of a reporting system that might be:
   - Under development
   - Used in future features
   - Legacy code that can be removed

### Safe Actions
1. **Keep all files:** No files should be removed - they're all part of the modular architecture
2. **Review unused functions:** Consider removing the 4 unused functions if they're truly not needed

### Verification Steps
1. Check if the unused functions are referenced in any documentation
2. Verify if they're part of a planned feature
3. Test removal of unused functions to ensure no breaking changes

## Conclusion

The ALIVA Dashboard has a well-structured modular architecture with minimal unused code. Only 4 utility functions appear to be unused, representing excellent code hygiene. The previous false positives were due to the sophisticated modular loading system that dynamically sources files.

**Risk Assessment:** Low - only 4 functions are potentially unused, and these are safely removable if confirmed unnecessary.
